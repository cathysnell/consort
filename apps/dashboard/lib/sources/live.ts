// The LIVE source: a Consort project being worked on right now.
//
// Reads a watched `.sftdd/` directory — `agent-log.jsonl` for the timeline, `next.json` and
// the feature-status CLI for the snapshot half, and Claude transcript mtimes for session
// liveness. All of that I/O already lived in lib/consort.ts and stays there; this file is
// the interface wrapper, so behavior is unchanged by construction rather than by careful
// re-transcription. (Moving ~340 lines of I/O wholesale is exactly how the derive.ts
// extraction broke two functions mid-move; the equivalence is the point, not the file
// layout.)
//
// One path: a recorded corpus can be replayed, a live build can be seen. A live build now records
// every turn into its OWN `.consort/` (drive.cli/executor: turns/ + transcripts + a produced/deleted
// INDEX; NO content snapshot), so this source reads its own turns exactly as a ReplaySource reads a
// corpus , the companion IS `.consort` (or an external RECORD_DIR capture when one is set).
//
//   Before the first turn lands — `agent-log.jsonl` + produced artifacts only. transcripts /
//     correspondence stay off (no turns/index.json yet); the FidelityBanner shows "not captured yet".
//   Once `.consort/turns/` has a turn — the source gains transcripts + correspondence, DELEGATING
//     turn()/transcript()/correspondence to a ReplaySource over `.consort`. Two content differences
//     from a full capture, because the live record is index-only: turn FILE content is read at HEAD
//     (readProjectFileAtHead) rather than a frozen per-turn copy, and stepOutputs reads the live
//     `.consort/` tree at HEAD (no recorded-artifacts mirror). Not historically accurate , by design.
//   artifactContent is HEAD-only throughout (the file `artifact.written` named, as it is NOW).

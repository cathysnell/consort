// The ONE active-highlight colour, derived from the ONE `focus`. It reflects WHO is in charge, so
// every surface — the workflow node, the active lane panel, the active step — reads the same key and
// can never disagree about the active colour:
//   step       → the working agent's role colour (shows WHICH agent is working)
//   gate       → purple (a human gate is WAITING)
//   escalation → red (a gate is RAISING)
//   idle       → slate (the deterministic orchestrator is in charge — dispatching, between turns)
//
// Step ids are unique across lanes, so a whole-workflow scan resolves the working step's role
// without needing the lane. A working step always owns a role; the accent fallback is only for a
// (never-current) roleless step, and slate is the orchestrator-in-charge default.

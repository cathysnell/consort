// step-contract: the ONE step interface every role/step implements.
//
// A step is producers→consumers, inputs→outputs. This module defines the single
// contract that carries all three faces of a step together, so each step can be
// invoked and unit-tested in isolation:
//   - inputs(action)  : the INPUT contract  – what must exist on disk before it runs.
//   - outputs(action) : the OUTPUT expectation – what artifact it must produce.
//   - route(completed): the ROUTING proposal – where it proposes to go next on
//                       completion of its agent call.
//
// The orchestrator does NOT blindly follow the routing proposal: `validateAndBound`
// VALIDATES it against the pure allowed transition and BOUNDS re-routes/retries with the
// EXISTING limits (revise budget, ExpectationLedger retry, escalation) before honoring
// it, falling back to state-derivation when the proposal is off the allowed graph.
//
// This slice is the CONTRACT + a MOCK implementation + `validateAndBound`. No real role
// implements StepContract yet; `runDriver` consumes the routing face behind an optional
// seam so the default (no-contract) path is byte-identical to today. Real roles implement
// StepContract in a later slice; the input/output faces (inputs/outputs) are declared here
// so the per-step isolated runner + `--step` CLI can consume them next.

// ─── OUTPUT CHANNELS: contained vs uncontained file access ─────────────────────────────
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. A step's outputs do not all belong in the same place. Some MUST be
// written into the real, shared, uncontained code tree (each build turn reads the prior
// turn's code, so the driver's `app/` and the navigator's `tests/` accumulate at the
// project root and get committed / migrated / deployed). Others are per-turn bookkeeping
// or per-feature design docs that the orchestrator wants to CONTAIN – place under a
// dedicated root it owns, so a turn can be sandboxed (a per-experiment worktree, a scratch
// dir) without polluting the shared tree. The channel model is the one rule that lets a
// manifest declare WHICH kind each output is, without the step (or the manifest author)
// hardcoding a directory. It is the seam between "the agent wrote a file called X" and
// "the file X lives HERE for this run".
//
// THE THREE CHANNELS:
//   product  – the application deliverable: app/ – tests/ – migrations. ALWAYS UNCONTAINED
//              (resolves to workspaceDir = the real code tree). It accumulates across build
//              turns and ships, so it can never be sandboxed away from the tree the next
//              turn reads. e.g. the driver's `code` (app/), the navigator's `tests`.
//   artifact – the .consort design documents the design roles author (feature-spec,
//              architecture, db-design, test-list, design-guide, acs, estimates,
//              proposals). Small + per-feature, so MAY be contained: resolves under
//              `artifactDir` when the orchestrator provisions one, else the workspace.
//   meta     – the orchestrator's bookkeeping ABOUT the turn (the reconciled agent-log,
//              a reflect verdict, an assess marker). CONTAINED: resolves under `metaDir`
//              when provisioned, else the workspace.
//
// HOW A MANIFEST USES IT (the rule for every step):
//   1. Set `channel` to the kind of output it is (omit only for a legacy single-root turn;
//      absent === product/workspaceDir, byte-identical to a pre-channel turn).
//   2. Keep `filename` CHANNEL-RELATIVE – the path WITHIN that channel's root
//      (e.g. "feature-spec.json", "features/<F>/feature-spec.json", "agent-log.jsonl",
//      "app", "tests"). NEVER prefix it with ".consort/" or the project root; the
//      orchestrator prepends the channel root. A leading ".consort/" double-encodes the
//      root once artifactDir/metaDir are provisioned (=> `.consort/.consort/...`).
//   3. The orchestrator resolves the placement: `resolveChannelRoot(channel, roots)` joins
//      the file under product→workspaceDir / artifact→artifactDir / meta→metaDir (each
//      falling back to workspaceDir when its contained root is not provisioned). A run that
//      provisions neither contained root is byte-identical to a single-root turn – which is
//      why an untagged / un-provisioned manifest keeps working.
//
// So a step stays dumb + contained: it declares "I produce the design-guide (artifact) and
// an agent-log (meta)"; the orchestrator decides those land under `.consort` for a normal
// run, or under a sandboxed artifact/meta root for a parallel-experiment run – the manifest
// never changes. See provisioning/channels.ts for the resolver + ChannelRoots.
//

// Step: the GENERIC StepContract, driven entirely by a step manifest (DATA) + the
// validator registry (CODE) + an injected agent. This is the NORM – a step is one JSON
// manifest + (only if a new output type appears) one registered validator fn. A bespoke
// StepContract class is the escape hatch, for a step whose run() logic is genuinely custom.
//
// Containment is unchanged from SpecAuthorBreakdownStep: the ORCHESTRATOR owns .consort,
// resolves + PROVIDES the input contents + the workspace, and VALIDATES + persists the
// produced output. This step is dumb: it declares its logical inputs/outputs (from the
// manifest), forwards the provided instructions to its injected agent pointed at the
// provided workspace, and reports what appeared THERE. Neither it nor its agent resolves
// .consort or reaches outside what it was handed.
//
//   inputs()  -> manifest.inputs (logical ids; the orchestrator resolves + provides).
//   outputs() -> manifest.outputs, each with check = resolveValidator(name).
//   conformanceValidators() -> the same validators, with a docstring, exposed to the agent.
//   route()   -> manifest.routing[outcome] (a produced proposal by default).
//   run()     -> verify provided inputs (fail loud), invoke the agent contained to the
//                workspace, report the produced path(s) at the declared output locations.

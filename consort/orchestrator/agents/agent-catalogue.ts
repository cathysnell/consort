// agent-catalogue: the catalogue of concrete StepAgent KINDS a user assembles into a step
// manifest BY NAME. A manifest declares `agent: { kind, config }`; the runner resolves the
// kind against this catalogue and builds the agent from `config` + a build CONTEXT.
//
// The split that keeps manifests portable:
//   - config  (in the manifest, DATA): the agent's own knobs – claude levers, replay seeds,
//              mock fixtures. Part of the step's definition; travels with it.
//   - context (from the runner, ENV): corpusRoot / kitDir / workspaceDir – per-run,
//              per-machine paths. NOT in the manifest.
//
// Catalogued kinds (each documented so a user can pick when authoring a manifest):
//   - claude : the REAL agent – spawns `claude -p --agent <role>` from the config levers.
//   - replay : emits RECORDED artifacts (copies configured seeds from the corpus) – the
//              offline/headless agent. No model, no cloud.
//   - mock   : a test double that writes configured fixture outputs – for unit tests.
//
// resolveAgentKind / buildAgent throw loud on an unknown kind (a manifest typo is a hard
// failure surfaced at build time, never a silent default).

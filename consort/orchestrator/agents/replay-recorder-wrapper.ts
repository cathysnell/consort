// replay-recorder-wrapper: a StepAgent DECORATOR that records what a turn produced into a corpus
// , the mirror of the step-aware replay agent. Replay READS the corpus by step (makeStepReplayAgent);
// Record WRAPS whatever agent ran (claude live, contained, or even a replay for corpus migration),
// lets it produce its delta, then WRITES that delta + the recorded transcript into the corpus keyed
// by the step's action. Both sit on the ONE buildAgent seam: recording a NEW live scenario is just
// wrapping the live `claude` agent. Same corpus format out (turns/NNNN-<label>/{turn.json,files/} +
// recorded-build/.../turns/NNN), so a recorded run is directly replayable.
//
// It REUSES the existing corpus writers verbatim (recordTurn + recordBuildTurn), never reinventing
// them , the recorder is the single source of the corpus format, shared by the drive.cli effects
// wrappers and this decorator. The only difference is WHERE it fires: this wraps the agent's invoke()
// (so it's selected per-step via buildAgent), the effects wrappers wrap perform() (whole-turn).
//
// Baseline: recordTurn diffs the workspace against a delta baseline seeded once per corpus. The
// wrapper seeds it lazily on the first wrapped invoke (guarded), mirroring withTurnRecording.

// The action->key MAP for the per-invocation KEY a role's effort/model config is applied on
// ("apply to the step, not the role"). The KEY TYPES themselves (BuildTurn/DesignStep/TurnKey/
// EffortLevel) are PURE unions with zero imports, so they live in the lowest config layer
// (consort/config/step-key.ts); this module imports them DOWN and RE-EXPORTS them so its long-
// standing callers (which import the types from here) keep working unchanged. The MAP stays here
// because it needs a WorkflowAction. Both the settings resolver and the drive effects derive the
// key from this ONE place – without an import cycle.

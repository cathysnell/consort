// Orchestrator driver loop (deterministic-driver phase 2: effect seams).
//
// Phase 1 (orchestrator-drive.ts) is the pure brain: nextTransition(state) ->
// the single next WorkflowAction. This module is the body: a loop that reads
// state, asks the brain for the next action, and performs that action's side
// effect, until the action is `done`. The side effects live behind the
// DriveEffects interface so the loop is hermetically testable with an in-memory
// fake; the real effects (claude -p --agent, cut/merge experiment,
// createSchemaMigration, collapseMigrationHeads, deploy, structured log) are
// injected in phase 3.
//
// This is what makes the per-story pipeline actually STREAM: because one
// process holds both lanes, nextTransition dispatches story 1 to the build lane
// the moment its gate is approved, while the design lane keeps designing later
// stories. (Under the old split /design-then-/build `claude -p` invocations the
// streaming could not happen: two processes, no shared loop.)

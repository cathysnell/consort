// executor-dispatch: the DRIVE's executor-dispatch machinery (Stage 2, #578) , the seam that lets
// the LIVE runDriver loop route selected agent turns THROUGH the StepExecutor's Template Method
// instead of `effects.perform` -> commandsForAction -> runner. Extracted out of the 2000-line
// orchestrator-effects.ts into its own cohesive family module (the "every seam in a function-family
// module" migration metric), re-imported by buildDriveEffects.performViaExecutor.
//
// Dependency-injected (no runtime import of orchestrator-effects, so no import cycle): the caller
// supplies the command-derivation primitives it already owns in that module , buildCycleCommand
// (the ONE shared cycle-CLI derivation), readDriveStateFromDisk (fresh post-turn state), the bin
// tokens, and LOG_BIN. Everything else is this family's own (Step, the unified ClaudeStepAgent on
// its live-dispatch seam, execute) or the manifest registry.
//
// Two turn shapes flow through here today (each added to executorDispatched one at a time, each
// with its byte-identical golden):
//   - spec-author breakdown (DESIGN): single-shot, feature-scoped inputs, artifact-channel output,
//     pre-turn reset-breakdown + post-turn sync-breakdown.
//   - navigator RED (BUILD, LEAN , no cloud): story-scoped inputs, PRODUCT-channel output (the real
//     tests/ tree at the project root), post-turn `@build-cycle` (the RED cycle stamp).

// route-scenarios: the CATALOGUE of route pathways out of a spec-author breakdown, each an
// isolated scenario the suite runs in its own throwaway `.consort` workspace (LEAN – no cloud
// project). One entry per outcome of the StepOutcome space:
//   produced  -> the honest next hop (ux-designer) – the happy path.
//   revise    -> a routable spec smell routes back to the spec-author at Gate 1.
//   escalate  -> a non-routable blocking escalation halts to the HIL.
//
// Every scenario shares the demo's PO-seed + spec-author-breakdown manifests + intake; they
// differ only in whether an escalation is injected before the step under test and what route is
// expected. No env/cloud needed – the route depends on `.consort` state, which the driver builds
// on a temp dir.

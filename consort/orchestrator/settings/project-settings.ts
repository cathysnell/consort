// The project SETTINGS RESOLVER: it layers the per-step model/effort resolution (which needs the
// shipped step-manifests + the action->turn-key map) ON TOP of the low config-file primitive
// (consort/config/consort-config-file.ts). Every project setting resolves sftdd-config.json -> code
// default, with no env or flag override at read time. Writers: create-project (create-time) and the
// drive's write-through override flags. The resolved result is what the driver runs with and what
// run-config.json snapshots. Run-mode knobs (record/replay/headless/debug) are not project settings;
// they stay explicit env inputs, read via consortEnv.
//
// The FILE half (shape, load/write, the build/plan/project resolution) lives DOWN in the config
// primitive so a domain module that only reads the file (intake, project-consort-setup) depends
// downward without reaching UP into this resolver. This module owns ONLY the model/effort layer,
// which is genuinely high (it consumes steps/manifest + drive/turn-key). The file symbols + turn-key
// types are RE-EXPORTED here so the many callers that have long imported them from this module keep
// working unchanged.
//
// Model knobs mirror what `claude -p` exposes: model, effort (low|medium|high|xhigh|max|default),
// fallbackModel, maxBudgetUsd.

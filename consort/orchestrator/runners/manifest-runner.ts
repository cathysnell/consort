// manifest-runner: the bridge from a step MANIFEST to the orchestrator (the StepExecutor /
// Template Method). It resolves the action to its manifest, builds the generic Step
// (manifest + injected agent + validator registry), assembles the orchestrator-owned seams the
// executor drives (resolve inputs from the shared workspace, provision it, source
// instructions, reconcile routing), and runs the fixed 7 phases – so a caller drives a
// manifest end to end without hand-wiring StepCtx/StepExecutorDeps every turn.
//
//   runManifestStep  – run ONE manifest through the executor, return its StepResult.
//   runManifestChain – follow each turn's routing to the next matching manifest until the
//                      chain leaves the manifest set (a terminal / off-graph action). This is
//                      the 2-turn stockflow demo: PO seed -> spec-author breakdown -> done.
//
// Routing authority: a standalone manifest set has no separate pure transition graph – the
// manifest routing IS the transition function. So the runner's validateAndBound `allowed`
// dep returns the step's own proposed next, i.e. the manifest's routing map is authoritative.
// (In the full orchestrator the pure nextTransition is the authority; here the manifests are.)

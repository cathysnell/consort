// The test-analyst ROSTER renderer: the pure projection that bridges the TS TEST_ANALYST_CATALOGUE
// (which a `claude -p` supervisor agent can't import) into a text block the supervisor reads and
// Task-spawns from. A preconditions PREPARER ("test-analyst-roster", registered in preconditions.ts)
// calls renderTestAnalystRoster with the turn's projectDir; it resolves the project's uiTrack, FILTERS
// the catalogue to the ENABLED analysts (a no-frontend project drops `client`), and emits the enabled
// roster + each analyst's focus prompt + declared inputs as a fenced JSON block appended to the
// supervisor's task. The supervisor spawns ONE general-purpose Task subagent per listed analyst with
// the given focus_prompt, then reconciles + assembles. Pure projection (no disk writes), so it can't
// drift from the catalogue – the single source of truth.

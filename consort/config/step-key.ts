// The per-invocation KEY a role's effort/model config is applied on ("apply to the step, not
// the role"): a BUILD turn OR a DESIGN step. These are PURE type unions with ZERO imports – the
// lowest config layer, so ANY layer (the config-file primitive, the settings resolver, the drive
// effects) may name them without an import cycle. The action->key MAP (turnKeyForAction) needs a
// WorkflowAction and so stays UP in drive/turn-key.ts, which re-exports these for its callers.

/** The BUILD turns whose effort/model can differ within the navigator/driver loop.
 *  Each is a DISTINCT kind of work, so each can pick its own model/effort ("apply to
 *  the turn, not the role"):
 *   navigator (judgment): red (author tests), review (critique code), assess (scope
 *     contamination-fragile tests before a refactor/deploy).
 *   driver (code): green (implement), refactor (restructure code), repair (fix a
 *     regression a prior story's build broke).
 *  The specialized drive buildModes collapse onto these base families – they are the
 *  same KIND of work, differing only in what triggered them:
 *   refactor-deploy / refactor-superseded -> refactor;  assess-deploy / assess-refactor
 *   -> assess;  green-superseded -> green.
 *   reflect (the design-lane critic that grades completed code) is its own tunable turn:
 *     the optimize sweep measured it distinctly (haiku+low won), so it keys separately
 *     rather than riding the navigator scalar. */

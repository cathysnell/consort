// Universal turn recorder: a first-class capture of EVERY state-machine turn the
// deterministic driver takes (design, gates, build, deploy, accept, promote),
// recording the artifacts that turn produced as a replayable timeline.
//
// This generalizes the build-only recorder (recordBuildTurn) to the whole
// machine , the design lane in particular had no recorder, so the design corpus
// used to be hand-assembled. Wired via `withTurnRecording` (drive.cli.ts), gated
// on LAKEBASE_CONSORT_RECORD_DIR, fired AFTER each turn's effect lands.
//
// Layout under recordDir (the answer to "record every step, replayably"):
//   turns/<NNNN>-<label>/turn.json   , manifest {step, kind, role, mode, story, ac, action, produced[], deleted[]}
//   turns/<NNNN>-<label>/files/<rel> , the .consort + code DELTA this turn produced
//   turns/index.json                 , the ordered list of every recorded turn
//   recorded-artifacts/<rel under .consort> , the CUMULATIVE .consort mirror, so the
//                                          existing replayDesignTurn(replayDir=
//                                          recorded-artifacts) consumes it as-is
//   .recorder-state.json             , internal file-hash map for delta computation
//
// recorded-build/ (the per-turn code corpus replayBuildTurn reads) is populated
// by the existing recordBuildTurn, which `withTurnRecording` calls for build
// turns , so design + build replay both round-trip from one recordDir.

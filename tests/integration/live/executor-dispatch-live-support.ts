// Shared support for the DESIGN-role executor-dispatch LIVE proofs (Stage 2 of the channel-model
// live-proof plan, task #641). Each per-role live test is a thin wrapper that names its role +
// calls runDesignExecutorDispatchLive(SPEC) so the file stays a few lines.
//
// WHAT THIS PROVES (that the hermetic perform-via-executor golden + the isolated runIntegrationChain
// tests do NOT): a REAL `claude -p` agent, dispatched THROUGH the SHIPPED performViaExecutor path
// (buildDriveEffects(cfg).performViaExecutor -> performTurnViaExecutor -> execute()), with the
// shipped manifests' input `source` strings resolving on a real `.consort` tree (the {feature}/
// {story} scope fix), lands its artifact under the provisioned `.consort` via the channel model +
// the reconciled agent-log under `.consort` (meta). This is the LIVE half of retirement-map step (2).
//
// LEAN – NO cloud. Every design role is tool-scoped to Write/Read (never runs ./scripts/lk) and
// reports via the agent-report channel; the turn runs in a throwaway project dir. We call
// performViaExecutor DIRECTLY with the design action (rather than driving the whole runDriver loop):
// that exercises the identical dispatch + input-resolution + channel-placement + validate path a
// production turn takes, without seeding the pipeline state nextTransition would need to route there
// – the routing itself is proven hermetically + by the navigator-red production-drive test.
//
// NOT a .test.ts itself (no vitest include match), so importing it adds no suite.

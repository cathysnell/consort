 *     contamination-fragile tests before a refactor/deploy).
 *   driver (code): green (implement), refactor (restructure code), repair (fix a
 *     regression a prior story's build broke).
 *  The specialized drive buildModes collapse onto these base families – they are the
 *  same KIND of work, differing only in what triggered them:
 *   refactor-deploy / refactor-superseded -> refactor;  assess-deploy / assess-refactor
 *   -> assess;  green-superseded -> green.
 *   reflect (the design-lane critic that grades completed code) is its own tunable turn:
 *     the optimize sweep measured it distinctly (haiku+low won), so it keys separately
 *     rather than riding the navigator scalar. */
